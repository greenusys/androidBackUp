            android:text="The momentum possessed by a body is generally defined as the product of its mass and velocity.\nFrom Newton's second law it follows that, if a constant force acts on a particle for a given time, the product of force and the time interval (the impulse) is equal to the change in the momentum.

Conversely, the momentum of a particle is a measure of the time required for a constant force to bring it to rest.

The momentum of any collection of particles is equal to the vector sum of the individual momenta.

According to Newton's third law, the particles exert equal and opposite forces on one another, so any change in the momentum of one particle is exactly balanced by an equal and opposite change of the momentum of another particle.

Thus, in the absence of a net external force acting on a collection of particles, their total momentum never changes; this is the meaning of the law of conservation of momentum"

            android:text="Angular momentum is obtained by multiplying a body's mass by its angular velocity.

This means that a single body can have two types of angular momentum. For example, planetary bodies such as Earth have a first momentum that is calculated from the results of its motion in relation to the sun, and then an additional momentum calculated from the velocity of its spin on its own axis.


The smaller the body is, the faster it will spin when it is being moved as a consequence of angular momentum.

This explains why figure skaters spin much faster when they are low to the ground and when their arms are wrapped around themselves, compared to when there are standing tall with arms wide-open."

            android:text="Linear momentum, also known as force, is the quantity of mass associated with a body that moves along a straight path. An outside object, with its own force, can change the trajectory of an object with a linear momentum.\nFor example, if you are running forward and a dog runs into you by accident, your trajectory will be changed, and you may fall; however, you should not be hurt too badly because the momentum of the dog was similar to yours.

However, if you get hit by a truck, which has a higher linear momentum because of its high weight, you will be lucky to survive. That is because the truck's force is higher than yours.\n\nExamples::
Example 1\n

Calculate the change in momentum cause by 50-kg car moving at 9 m/s.\n\n

Solution

Since M = m x v where m = mass and v is velocity\n

M = 50 x 9 = 450 kgm/s\n

Example 2\n

A lorry has a momentum of 200. What would be the car's new momentum if its velocity is tripled?\n\n

Solution

M = M x 3 = 200 X 3 = 600\n"
